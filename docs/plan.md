# The Adelphi Manhattan Center Plan of Study

## Summer 1: Tech Institute

The _Tech Institute_ lasts for 4 weeks, where students attend classes at the Manhattan Center. (We may need to fine tune this schedule, if we want to accommodate working students who are not teachers).

Sample schedule:

Time            Course
-------------   -----------------------------------------------------
**Week 1-2**        --
9:00-12:30pm    CSC 601 Introduction to computer programming
2:30-6:00pm     EDT 501 Digital Literacies
**Week 2-3**        --
9:00-12:30pm    EDT 601 Programming web-based educational media
2:30-6:00pm     EDT 606 Educational information systems and networks

In addition to the regular courses, each week of the institute the students will attend a related lecture or event.

## Fall
The following courses will be offered online, using a variety of synchronous and asynchronous formats.

* EDT 503 Technology and the School Curriculum

_Electives: (choose 1)_

* EDT 510 Teaching with social media
* EDT 511 Learning with video games
* EDT 512 Mobile Learning
* EDT 513 Distance learning, blended classes, and virtual schools

## EDT 603 Philosophy of Technology: Student Unconference
In this unique hybrid course, students will read and discuss a series of literature related to the conference theme, beginning 3 weeks prior to the conference.

The Program in Educational Technology will organize a two-day student conference on one Fall Friday and Saturday. We will have an open call for participation, which will be publicized at other regional universities. In addition to the students, we will invite established scholars to present keynote speakers for Day 1 and Day 2 of the event. The event will follow the "unconfernce" model, where every participant presents as well as attends. To this end, we will have a variety of formats (presentations, discussions, lightning talks, demos, performances, etc).

Intensive Masters students (and others who wish to receive graduate credit) will be required to participate in pre-conference readings and discussions online, prior to the conference. Credit-bearing students will also write and present a formal paper at the conference.


## Winter/Intersession
We will run a new 2-week intensive intersession class, "Educational Technology in the City" organized around the idea of visiting local institutions related to educational technology. Typically we would meet at the site, and then use our online tools for discussions, readings, and follow-ups. The course would culminate in the students designing their own unit for using field trips to teach an aspect of educational technology.

Students in the _non-certification_ track do not have a residency requirement for the second summer, and will be able to complete their degree by satisfying the online requirements for EDT 802.
