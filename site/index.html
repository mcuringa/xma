            <strong>Educational technology</strong> is an
            interdisciplinary field found at the intersection of
            learning sciences, media studies, computer science &amp;
            information systems, and teaching.

            <br />
            The <strong>design track</strong> prepares candidates for
            careers in educational technology in higher education,

            <h3>Learning Sciences</h3>
            <p>We study how people learn. We want to know about how the
            mind works, processing knowledge. We also study how people
            learn together, in interaction with the world.</p>

        <div id="designing" class="left">
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>We educators engage in
            many types of design: curriculum design,
            interaction design, game design, multimedia design, data
            visualization, lesson design, software design, and more.
            We advance our design thinking and skills through hands-on
            studios and projects.</p>

            <h3>Hacking</h3>
            <p>In programming, hacking
            emphasizes the creative, playful side of writing code;
            with an emphasis on seeing beyond apparent limitations.
            We study programming, networking, and hardware so we know
            how to change them.</p>
